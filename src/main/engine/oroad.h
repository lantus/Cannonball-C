/***************************************************************************
    Road Rendering & Control

    This is a complete port of the 68000 SUB CPU Program ROM.
    
    The original code consists of a shared Sega library and some routines
    which are OutRun specific.
    
    Some of the original code is not used and is therefore not ported.
    
    This is the most complex area of the game code, and an area of the code
    in need of refactoring.

    Useful background reading on road rendering:
